# FunctionPlotter

Function Plotter is a simple C++ (Qt) program which takes a mathematical function definition "f(x)" as it's input and illustrates it on a two-dimensional graph (x-y). The figure in below, show the program in runtime.

## Purpose of the project

Imagine that you're writing an industrial program to drive a universal testing machine, which compresses metals and measures the force throughout the experiment until it breaks. Let's assume that a client comes to you and asks for computing the pressure from the formula 'P=m/F'. Easy peasy! We can implement this equation in our program in the blink of an eye. but what if other customers require different formulas? What happens if someone asks you to allow him to put his formula dynamically into the application, while there are countless equations that could be defined? Well, to cope with situations, you will need a Function Evaluation Algorithm.

There is a vast collection of function assessment algorithms. The most simple and trivial one which is also the basis of our program is explained expressively in [here](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/BasicDS/InfixPrefixandPostfixExpressions.html). We will also explain it in a quick way.
